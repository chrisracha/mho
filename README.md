# Modified Hippopotamus Optimization (MHO) Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Modified Hippopotamus Optimization (MHO)** algorithm, a novel metaheuristic optimization technique developed as part of a thesis research project. MHO is an enhanced version of the original Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm, incorporating several key modifications to improve convergence and solution quality.

## üéØ Research Objective

The primary goal of this research is to enhance the performance of the original Hippopotamus Optimization algorithm through strategic modifications, particularly focusing on:

1. **Chaotic Initialization**: Using sine chaotic maps for improved population diversity
2. **Enhanced Convergence**: Modified convergence factors for better exploration-exploitation balance
3. **Reverse Learning**: Small-hole imaging reverse learning mechanism for escaping local optima
4. **Real-world Application**: Applied to a sample land allocation and scheduling problem

## üöÄ Key Features

### MHO Modifications

1. **Sine Chaotic Map Initialization** (MHO Eq. 1, 4, 5)
   - Uses `x_{k+1} = Œ± * sin(œÄ * x_k)` for chaotic sequence generation
   - Improves initial population diversity and distribution

2. **Modified Convergence Factor** (MHO Eq. 13)
   - `T_mho_conv = 1 - (t/T_max)^6`
   - Enhanced convergence control compared to original HO

3. **Small-hole Imaging Reverse Learning** (MHO Eq. 18)
   - `X_rev = (lb + ub) - X_current`
   - Helps escape local optima and explore solution space more effectively

### Problem Domain

The algorithm is tested on **crop allocation optimization** problems with the following characteristics:
- **Objective**: Maximize profit from crop harvesting
- **Constraints**: Land allocation limits, double cropping restrictions
- **Variables**: Harvest amounts per crop per month
- **Dimensions**: Configurable (default: 2 crops √ó 3 months = 6 variables)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm Components

1. **Population Initialization**
   ```cpp
   // Sine chaotic map for initialization
   double sine_map(double x, double alpha) {
       return alpha * sin(M_PI * x);
   }
   ```

2. **Three-Phase Optimization**
   - **Phase 1**: Position update with convergence-based logic
   - **Phase 2**: Defense against predators using Levy flight
   - **Phase 3**: Escape mechanism for exploitation

3. **Constraint Handling**
   - Bounds enforcement
   - Land allocation constraints
   - Double cropping restrictions

### Algorithm Parameters

```cpp
int N = 10;                    // Population size
int T_max = 500;              // Maximum iterations
double alpha_chaos = 0.99;    // Chaos coefficient
```

## üìä Problem Formulation

### Objective Function
Maximize profit: `Œ£(i,j) X[i,j] * (G[i,j] - C[i,j])`
- `X[i,j]`: Harvest amount for crop i in month j
- `G[i,j]`: Gross return for crop i in month j
- `C[i,j]`: Cost for crop i in month j

### Constraints
1. **Bounds**: `0 ‚â§ X[i,j] ‚â§ MHA[i]`
2. **Land Allocation**: `Œ£(dt=0 to t_growth-1) X[i,(m-dt+months)%months] ‚â§ TLA[i]`
3. **Double Cropping**: `Œ£(j=0 to months-1) X[i,j] ‚â§ 2 * TLA[i]`
